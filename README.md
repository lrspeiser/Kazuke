# Kazuke (数加)

## About This Project

Kazuke (数加), which means "number addition" in Japanese, is a puzzle game I developed with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs). This project showcases the potential of AI-assisted development in creating interactive web applications.

## How the Game Works

Kazuke is a tile-based puzzle game where the objective is to create valid number combinations on a 6x6 grid. Here's how to play:

1. The game starts with a grid containing some preset tiles with numbers.
2. You have a row of draggable tiles at the top of the screen.
3. Drag and drop tiles onto the grid to create valid combinations.
4. A valid combination is formed when:
   - The sum of a sequence of tiles equals the last or first tile in that sequence.
   - The sequence must be at least 3 tiles long.
5. When a valid combination is formed, those tiles are cleared, and you earn points.
6. The game continues until the grid is full and no more moves are possible.

Try to achieve the highest score by creating multiple combinations and thinking strategically about tile placement!

## Technology Stack

Kazuke is built using the following technologies:

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and interactivity
- Canvas API for rendering the game board and tiles

The game is designed to be responsive and playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
